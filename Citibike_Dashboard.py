    As the **lead analyst** for Citi Bike, this dashboard aims to support the **business strategy team** in evaluating the current **logistics model** and uncovering opportunities for expansion, based on 2022 data.  
    Citi Bike has seen significant growth since its launch in 2013, with ridership demand surging post-Covid-19. In 2022, this surge has led to challenges such as:
    - **Bike shortages** at high-demand stations  
    - **Docking issues** at overcrowded stations  
    - **Customer complaints** related to bike availability  
    
    To help address these issues, the dashboard is divided into 5 key sections:
    - üå¶Ô∏è **Weather Impact on Bike Usage**: Examining how weather conditions influenced ridership in 2022
    - üö≤ **Most Popular Stations**: Identifying areas with the highest demand in 2022

    This chart illustrates the relationship between the number of daily bike rides and the average temperature in New York during 2022. 
    The data is resampled weekly, showing trends in bike ridership and temperature variations. 
    - The **blue line** represents the total number of bike rides per day.
    - The **red line** shows the average daily temperature.
    
    The chart allows us to analyze how temperature fluctuations correlate with bike usage patterns over time:
    - **Bike trips** generally increase as the weather warms up, especially during spring and summer months.
    - **Temperature spikes** are often followed by a noticeable rise in bike ridership.
    - On colder days, bike usage tends to drop, which is visible in the downward trends on the graph.

    This analysis helps us understand how external weather conditions can influence demand for bike sharing services and assists in optimizing bike distribution accordingly.

    - **Casual Riders**: One-time or occasional users who rent bikes without a membership.

    **Key Observations**:
    - **Median trip counts** for both members and casual riders are slightly above 1000 trips per day.
    - **Members** show a **wider interquartile range (IQR)**, indicating greater variability in daily trips. This suggests that some members use CitiBike frequently while others have more sporadic usage.
    - **Casual riders** have a **narrower IQR**, but the **lower-end outliers** suggest that some casual users occasionally take significantly fewer trips. These users may have irregular trip patterns, possibly linked to weather or seasonal trends.
    - The **whiskers for members** extend further than for casual riders, indicating that member trip counts fluctuate more widely. This could suggest that members, with frequent and varied use, may contribute to the supply-demand imbalance at specific stations.

    **Implication**: The box plot helps us understand the variability in trips by user type, highlighting that the **wide fluctuations in member trips** could contribute to the **cycling supply problem**, particularly during peak demand periods.

###### Recommendations ######

if page == "Recommendations":
    st.markdown("### ‚úÖ Recommendations and Strategic Insights for Citi Bike (2022)")

    st.markdown("""
    Based on the comprehensive analysis of Citi Bike trips in **2022**, we‚Äôve identified key operational patterns and supply-demand challenges. The following recommendations are designed to enhance **bike availability**, improve **logistics efficiency**, and support **strategic expansion** efforts:

    ### üö≤ **1. Optimize Bike Redistribution Strategies**
    - **Dynamic Rebalancing:** Implement real-time bike redistribution using predictive algorithms based on historical demand patterns and weather forecasts.
    - **Peak Hour Focus:** Allocate more resources for bike redistribution during **morning and evening peak hours**, especially at high-traffic stations like **Central Park S & 6 Ave** and **Roosevelt Island Tramway**.

    ### üìç **2. Expand Docking Stations Strategically**
    - **High-Demand Areas:** Add more docking stations near tourist hotspots (e.g., **5 Ave & E 72 St**, **Soissons Landing**) and major transit hubs to reduce overcrowding.
    - **Seasonal Adjustment:** Temporary expansion of docks in recreational areas during **summer months**, aligning with increased casual rider activity.

    ### üå¶Ô∏è **3. Weather-Responsive Operations**
    - **Flexible Supply Planning:** Adjust bike supply dynamically based on weather conditions, as ridership trends show a clear correlation with **temperature changes**.
    - **Rainy Day Promotions:** Introduce incentives for casual riders on days with lower demand to balance supply.

    ### üìä **4. Membership-Focused Campaigns**
    - **Targeted Member Growth:** Since **members contribute to wider fluctuations in trip patterns**, targeted marketing can help smooth out demand variability.
    - **Retention Initiatives:** Incentivize members to use less crowded stations with loyalty rewards.

    ### üìà **5. Data-Driven Decision Making**
    - **Real-Time Dashboard:** Equip the operations team with a real-time dashboard to monitor bike availability, station status, and demand trends.
    - **Continuous Monitoring:** Regularly update predictive models with fresh data to improve forecasting accuracy.

    ---

    **Final Insight:**  
    The key to solving Citi Bike‚Äôs supply challenges lies in leveraging **data-driven insights** to predict demand accurately and implement **agile redistribution strategies**. A proactive approach to managing peak demand, weather impacts, and user behaviour can significantly enhance the user experience across New York City.
